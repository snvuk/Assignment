## Itroduction python ##

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is used for a wide variety of applications.

## OOps Concept ##

 Python is also an object-oriented language since its beginning. It allows us to develop applications using an Object-Oriented approach. In Python, we can easily create and use classes and objects.
 
 Major principles of object-oriented programming system are 

- Class
- Object
- Method
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Data Abstraction
- Encapsulation

## Oparetor Precedence ##

Operator precedence is the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. In Python, operator precedence is determined by a set of rules that specify which operators are evaluated first when an expression is evaluated. 

## Expressions VS Statements ##

An expression is any valid unit of code that can be evaluated to a value. This can include variables, constants, function calls, and arithmetic or logical operations. When an expression is evaluated, it produces a result. For example, 2 + 3 is an expression that evaluates to 5.

A statement, on the other hand, is a complete line of code that performs an action or has an effect. Statements can include assignments, loops, conditionals, function definitions, and more. A statement can contain one or more expressions, but it does not necessarily need to evaluate to a value. For example, an assignment statement x = 3 assigns the value 3 to the variable x.

## Type Coversion ##

Type conversion, also known as type casting, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another data type. In Python, there are several built-in functions that can be used to perform type conversion, including:

int,float,str,bool
